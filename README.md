# rock_paper_scissorPy
Rock, paper, scissors is a guessing game. The user is asked to input their choice from either "r" for rock, "p" for paper and "s" for scissors. The input is compared to a random computer choice. If the user's choice is not equal to the computer's random choice the user loses the game. If the user's choice does not match the computer's choice, the user loses. If the user's choice is equal to the computer's choice, the user wins. 

Basically, the program takes the user input, compare it with the computer choice, then the outcome is determined.
